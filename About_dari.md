Certainly, I'll provide you with a comprehensive overview of the project details based on the information you've provided so far:

**Project Name:** Dari

**Description:** Dari is a real estate brokerage website that allows users to browse and search for houses available for sale, rent, or purchase. Users can view property details, images, and other relevant information. The website also offers various features to enhance user experience, such as interactive maps, virtual tours, and the ability to save favorite properties.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java framework)
- **Database:** MySQL (Relational database)
- **Authentication:** OAuth (User authentication)
- **Deployment:** Docker (Containerization), Jenkins (CI/CD)
- **Mapping:** Google Maps (Location visualization)

**Features and Services:**
1. Property Listing: Display properties available for sale, rent, or purchase.
2. Property Details: View detailed information about each property, including price, location, size, and features.
3. Interactive Maps: Show property locations on a Google Map.
4. Virtual Tours: Offer 3D virtual tours for properties.
5. User Authentication: Sign in and sign up using OAuth for user accounts.
6. Favorite Properties: Allow users to save and manage a list of their favorite properties.
7. Advanced Search: Search properties based on various parameters such as price, location, size, and property type.
8. Property Types: Support different property types (enum: house, apartment, villa).
9. House Parts: Enumerate house parts (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room) and their quantities.
10. CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete property listings.
11. User Profiles: Enable users to view and manage their profiles.
12. CI/CD Pipeline: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment using Jenkins.
13. Docker Containers: Package the application into Docker containers for portability and scalability.

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using Next.js, allowing for server-side rendering and a better user experience. It communicates with the backend API for data retrieval and updates.
- **Backend:** The backend is developed with Spring Boot, providing a RESTful API to manage property listings, user authentication, and other functionalities. It connects to the MySQL database for data storage.
- **Database:** MySQL is used to store property information, user data, and other relevant details.
- **Authentication:** OAuth is implemented for user sign-in and sign-up.
- **Deployment:** Docker containers are used for packaging the application, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments. Jenkins is set up to automate the CI/CD pipeline.

**Project Structure:**
The project is organized into various packages and classes, including:
- `com.dari.Dari`: Main application package.
- `com.dari.Dari.model`: Contains entity classes (e.g., `Item`, `User`) representing database tables.
- `com.dari.Dari.dao`: Contains repository interfaces (e.g., `ItemRepository`, `UserRepository`) for database operations.
- `com.dari.Dari.controller`: Contains controllers (e.g., `ItemController`) for handling HTTP requests.
- `com.dari.Dari.enums`: Contains enums defining constants (e.g., `HousePart`, `BuildingTypes`).
- Other packages for utilities, configuration, security, etc.

**Development Approach:**
- **Agile Sprint:** The project follows an Agile development approach with iterative sprints to build and deliver features incrementally.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Implement TDD to write tests before writing the actual code. This ensures code quality and functionality.
- **Learning Goals:** The project is designed to provide opportunities for learning and implementing new technologies, including Docker, Jenkins, OAuth, and more.

**Project Goals:**
The main goal of the Dari project is to create a functional real estate brokerage website that allows users to browse, search, and interact with property listings. Additionally, the project aims to:
- Enhance user experience through interactive features like maps and virtual tours.
- Implement user authentication for security and personalized experiences.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for automated deployment.
- Utilize Docker containers for easier deployment and scalability.
- Learn and apply various technologies and concepts in a practical context.
